<title>Spark Summit Proposal SF 2017</title>
<body>
<h1>Proposal for O'Reilly Spark Summit San Francisco in June 2017</h1>
<p><b>Track:</b> Spark Ecosystem</p>

<p><b>Title:</b> Exploring the Databricks Spark Reference Applications</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> If you need to write a Spark application, why not start by
copying a working program that demonstrates best practices, then modify it to suit
your needs? The Spark Reference Applications are four such programs: 3 written in Scala and 1 in Java.
Recently updated for Spark 2.0, this presentation discusses what these programs do, and
goes into detail on some code that might otherwise be difficult to understand.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This 30-minute presentation discusses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are reference apps for, in general?</li>
  <li>Brief overview of the 4 Spark reference apps:</li>
  <ol type='a'>
    <li>Spark concepts presented.</li>
    <li>Scala programming style and functional programming idioms used.</li>
    <li>Java version of the Log Analyzer Reference App.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Suggestions for how you might incorporate the concepts into your Spark project.</li>
</ol>
